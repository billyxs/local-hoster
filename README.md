local-hoster
============

Local Hoster helps you manage your system hosts and apache vhosts file, by allowing you to input the parameters into a web form.

Create links from your hosts file - /etc/hosts

Loop through each line in the /etc/hosts file to build links for all the projects you've configured
Starting a line with "#" will output a header
Starting a line with 127.0.0.1 will output a link

```You will still need to restart apache manually for the changes to take affect```
