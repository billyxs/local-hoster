local-hoster
============

Local Hoster helps you manage your system hosts and apache vhosts file, by allowing you to input the parameters into a web form.  It also gives you a landing page to view and link out to all your projects

<b>This application has been tested on OSX, Windows 7, and Ubuntu file system, but can be easily configured for your apache file path</b>

Create links from your hosts file - /etc/hosts

local-hoster will loop through each line in the /etc/hosts file to build links for all the projects you've configured

```You will still need to restart apache manually for the changes to take affect```
